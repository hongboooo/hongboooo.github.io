# About Me

Hi! My name is Zhuoyi Cheng (程卓艺). I am a second year Master student in the school of Software Technology at Zhejiang University. I'm working with [Prof. Lingyun Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zzW8d-wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the [International Design Institude (IDI)](http://www.idi.zju.edu.cn) of Zhejiang University. My current research seeks to enable AI agent as a collaborator in the design context. I am interested in delineating human-AI collaborative dynamics in the collaboration process, which helps develop guidelines to navigate the design of human-AI collaborative systems.

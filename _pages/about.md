# About Me

Hiüòä~ My name is <span style="color:#1a73e8">Hongbo</span>. I am a Phd Candidate in the College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University. I'm majoring in Design Science and working with [Prof. Lingyun Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zzW8d-wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
 <!-- at the [International Design Institude (IDI)](http://www.idi.zju.edu.cn) of Zhejiang University.  -->
 I focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). My main research area includes intelligent and generative system, XR + AI, and human-AI collaboration. My work has been published at some top-tire HCI venues, such as TOCHI, IJHCS, CHI, UIST, CSCW, and IJHCI.

<!-- I work on intuitive human-computer interaction & iteractive Human-AI co-creation. -->
<!-- 
**Intuitive Human-computer Interaction üëê**<br>
I explore natural and direct interaction modes, including gesture interaction, embodied interaction, and XR interaction. Aiming to improve the user experience, efficiency, and intuition through interaction mode innovation.

**Interactive Human-AI Co-creation ü§ñ**<br>
I explore the mechanism of Human-AI communication and cooperation. I focus on user-centered interacive AI system, investigating the role, cooperation mode, and contribution type of AI agent in co-creation process.

**Embodied & Generative System üëê + ü§ñ**<br>
I also focuse on the combination of the two aforementioned directions. I integrate intuitive interaction with GenAI in creative work for efficiency enhancement and creativity support, such as "AR + GenAI" and "TUI + GenAI". -->

# Research


During my Phd, I think of my research in the three categories below.


### 1Ô∏è‚É£Proposing User-centered Interactive and Generative Creation System


Generative AI has subverted the traditional creative mode. However, AI research always focuses on technological innovation, resulting in designers and creators still needing to adopt computer-centered interaction language (e.g., Bounding Box, semantic map) instead of their familiar design language and material (e.g., Sketch, Graphic Panel, Prototype). From the user-centered perspective, I integrate AI ability in creators‚Äô familiar habits, materials, and tools, proposing efficient and easy-to-use systems.

<span style="color:grey">For example, from the perspective of design materials, I combined the physical prototype material familiar to designers with Gen AI (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3654777.3676399">UIST‚Äô24</a>). From the perspective of design procedure, I enabled Gen AI to provide outputs based on the double-drill procedure, a classical design process, (IJHCSÔºåunder review). From the perspective of design methodology, I integrated traditional design methodologies (e.g., FBS, Co-Evolution) with Gen AI (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3654777.3676399">IJHCI‚Äô25</a>).</span>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£Exploring Intuitive and Embodied Creation Method in ‚ÄúAI+XR‚Äù 

Cognitive processes flow wherever it is cheaper to perform them, and the information representation modes are a way of changing creation and cognition. The creation space containing the physical world has distinct strengths, such as increasing sensorial stimuli, allowing tangible tests, and enhancing collaboration. I am interested in the intuitive and embodied creation method by combining AI and XR, exploring an intelligent, embodied, and generative creation space.

<span style="color:grey">For example, I proposed a prototype method combining the physical world and Gen AI (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3689433">TOCHI'23</a>). I explored the best practice of combining various AR approaches with Gen AI in different design tasks through empirical research (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713528">CHI'25</a>). Based on these theoretical guidelines, I utilized AR devices to implement embodied creation systems, such as Microsoft HoloLens (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3710979">CSWCW'25</a>) and Apple Vision Pro (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713686">CHI'25</a>).</span>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£Understanding Cognition and Creativity in Human-AI Co-creation

Gen AI can be a co-creator, changing the traditional creation paradigm, as well as cognition and creativity. The generative variability and uncertainty effectively expanded designers‚Äô creative exploration boundaries. It can also take over complex and tedious expression tasks so that designers can focus on creative contributions. I understand the cognition and creativity in human-AI co-creation. I also pay attention to the relationship between human&human and human&machine in co-creation.

<span style="color:grey">For example, I understand how creative stimulus combinations impact design outcomes and processes (Thinking Skill & Creativity‚Äô24). I also conducted an exploratory study on can AI awareness impact human-AI design collaboration (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3708359.3712162">IUI'25</a>).</span>

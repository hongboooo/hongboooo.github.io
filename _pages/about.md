# About Me

Hi😊! My name is [Hongbo]. I am Phd Candidate in the College of Computer Science at Zhejiang University. I'm working with [Prof. Lingyun Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zzW8d-wAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
 <!-- at the [International Design Institude (IDI)](http://www.idi.zju.edu.cn) of Zhejiang University.  -->
 My main research area is in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Design Science. My work has been publshed at top-tire HCI venues, such as TOCHI, IJHCS, UIST, CSCW, and IJHCI.

# Education<a id="Education"></a>

I work on intuitive human-computer interaction & iteractive Human-AI co-creation.

**Intuitive Human-computer Interaction 👐**<br>
I explore natural and direct interaction modes, including gesture interaction, body-based interaction, multi-sensory interaction, and XR interaction. Aiming to improve the user experience, efficiency, and intuition through interaction mode innovation.

**Iteractive Human-AI Co-creation 🤖**<br>
I explore the mechanism of Human-AI communication and cooperation. I focus on user-centered interacive AI system, investigating the role, cooperation mode, and contribution type of AI agent in co-creation process.

**👐 + 🤖**<br>
I also focuse on the combination of the two aforementioned directions. I explore the intuitive interaction + GenAI in creative work for efficiency enhancement and creativity support. I have conducted several studies in "AR + GenAI", "TUI + GenAI".

# RESEARCH<a id="Education"></a>

<!-- I work on intuitive human-computer interaction & iteractive Human-AI co-creation. -->

**Intuitive Human-computer Interaction 👐**<br>
I explore natural and direct interaction modes, including gesture interaction, embodied interaction, and XR interaction. Aiming to improve the user experience, efficiency, and intuition through interaction mode innovation.

**Interactive Human-AI Co-creation 🤖**<br>
I explore the mechanism of Human-AI communication and cooperation. I focus on user-centered interacive AI system, investigating the role, cooperation mode, and contribution type of AI agent in co-creation process.

**Embodied & Generative System 👐 + 🤖**<br>
I also focuse on the combination of the two aforementioned directions. I integrate intuitive interaction with GenAI in creative work for efficiency enhancement and creativity support, such as "AR + GenAI" and "TUI + GenAI".
